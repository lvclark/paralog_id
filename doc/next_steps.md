# Thoughts on a general protocol for sorting paralogs

If one tag belongs to multiple isoloci, either the whole marker has to be
discarded, or polyRAD needs better models for dealing with allopolyploidy.
This will certainly happen, so there should be mechanisms in place for
recognizing it.  (Not implemented yet.)  Using simulated data, what does
Hind/He look like for these?
